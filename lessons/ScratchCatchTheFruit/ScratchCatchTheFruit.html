            <h4><b>Instructions:</b></h4>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Choose the sprite you want your basket to be by selecting the button circled in red: <br>
                    <img src="basketselect.PNG" alt="Scratch" style="width:50%">

                </li>
                <li>
                    Select a backdrop of choice by going to backdrops and choosing from the various photos or uploading
                    your own. <br>
                    <img src="choosebackdrop.PNG" alt="Scratch" style="width:40%">

                </li>
                <li>
                    Give your basket the ability to move: Add a forever loop block (anything inside this will run
                    forever).
                    <br>Add 2 if statements, one that changes the x position of the bowl everytime the right arrow is
                    pressed, and
                    <br>the other that changes the x position of the bowl negatively everytime the left arrow is
                    pressed.<br>
                    This should allow you to move the bowl left and right based on your arrow keys! <br>
                    <img src="bowlcode1.PNG" alt="Scratch" style="width:20%">

                </li>
                <li>
                    Create a new sprite to represent the fruit to be caught:<br>
                    <img src="2ndsprite.PNG" alt="Scratch" style="width:20%"> <br>
                    In this sprite's code, we need to add a way for it to randomly spawn and fall to the floor. <br>
                    To do that we need to first add the block of code that makes the fruit go to a random position, and
                    then set it's y point to 180 (the top of the screeen). <br>
                    To cause it to fall to the floor, we need to add a forever loop. Within the forever loop, we change
                    the y position by a negative value. <br>
                    Finally, we need to add a if statement to check if the fruit hit the floor. If it did, we need to
                    add a block to respawn the fruit at a random position at the top of the screen. <br>
                    The code should look similar to the following: <br>
                    <img src="2ndcode.PNG" alt="Scratch" style="width:20%">

                </li>
                <li>
                    Now that we have a falling fruit and a moveable basket, we need to add code to enable the basket to
                    catch the fruit and give us points<br>
                    To do this, we first need to create a new variable called "score". In the fruit's code, we need to
                    set the score to 0 initially. <br>
                    We then need to add a forever loop, that checks if our fruit is touching our basket/bowl. If it is,
                    we need to increase our score by 1 and reset the position of the fruit. <br>
                    You can also add a sound of your choice when we catch a fruit. <br>
                    Your code in the fruit sprite's code should now look similar to the following: <br>
                    <img src="finalgoodapplecode.PNG" alt="Scratch" style="width:25%">

                </li>
                <li>
                    Now our game is fully working, however, there is no way to lose points. We can add a way to lose
                    points by creating a new sprite to represent a bad fruit: <br>
                    <img src="3rdsprite.PNG" alt="Scratch" style="width:20%"> <br>
                    We can copy the code from our "good" fruit to our new "bad" fruit's code. Once we copy it over, we
                    can change the score to decrease by 5 (or however mant points you desire). <br>
                    The final code for the bad fruit should look similar to the following:<br>
                    <img src="finalbadapplecode.PNG" alt="Scratch" style="width:25%">
                </li>
                <li>
                    To prevent our score from going into the negatives, we can add the following code to our basket's
                    code: <br>
                    <img src="basketcode.PNG" alt="Scratch" style="width:15%">

                </li>
                <li>
                    Our game is now complete. You can add more falling fruit by duplicating the current fruit sprites by
                    right clicking and pressing "duplicate". <br>
                    <img src="duplicate.PNG" alt="Scratch" style="width:20%"> <br>
                    From here on out, you can continue building this game, adding whatever you want to it. :)
